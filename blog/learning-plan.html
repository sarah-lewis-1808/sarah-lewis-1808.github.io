                <p>My learning plan describes how I will operate within the Dev Academy Foundations and Bootcamp Programme context. It will be negotiated with my peers and Facilitators as a Kaupapa for my individual learning. </p>
                

                <p>After exploring my values, identity and strengths I'll describe the motivations and values I will bring into my learning experience.</p>

                  <h3>What is your long term goal or career pathway? 
                  </h3>
                  <p>
                    The majority of jobs I've had have always seemed to constrict my ability to be creative. I'm unsure whether this is due to always feeling under pressure, and that in turn squashing any creativity, or whether the nature of the roles I've taken just don't really make room for it. To me, creativity is allowing my brain to do its thing without much conscious input. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    I think the most important aspect of a career for me at this stage would be one where I can start being myself and stop wearing the mask that fits the role. I'm hoping that this will be much easier if I'm no longer in a customer facing role. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    As this is all a very new revelation to me I'm not entirely sure what I'm looking for but I know that so far in the short duration of this course I've learned more about myself and what I want than in the previous 33 years of my life! I'm sure as I progress and make more new relationships I'll learn about plenty of new potential pathways to investigate but for now I'm enjoying the learning and I'm happy to see where this current path leads.
                    </p>

                  <h3>Describe your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning
                  </h3>
                  <p>
                    I struggled through school and university as I wasn't sure how I best learned. The learning environment was very prescriptive and rigid and as an undiagnosed ADHDer, at the time I couldn't for the life of me understand how people could thrive in that. I knew I wasn't stupid, but I didn't feel I was learning anything either. Turns out everyone was just remembering. Remembering is very two dimensional to me. Its not engaging enough to know <em>you must remember something</em>. Now I'm a bit more in tune with my methods of learning and I understand that I learn best when I'm doing. When all my senses are engaged and its me making the mistakes in real time! I don't mind making mistakes, provided I'm in an environment where it's allowed, so I feel that's a pretty good strength. 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This however can also be my downfall. If I've not had enough hands on experience with something and I move on too quickly I will forget completely. 
                  </p>
                  <p> I really enjoy tackling problems with other people, as I always feel it's more fun and builds a sense of kinship. I am always happy to acknowledge that other people have valuable view points and different experiences so I do think I work well learning as a team.
                  </p>

                  <h3>What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?
                  </h3>
                  <p>
                    My ability to communicate what I actually mean verbally is pretty poor, especially if its a complex thing I'm trying to describe. I do better if I'm able to show someone AND talk at the same time but talking in general is something I don't really enjoy as I always trip up. 
                  </p>
                </div>

                <div>
                <h3>How will you will manage your workload in this programme? 
                </h3>
                <p>
                  On the advice of the prep material I have implemented every possible thing suggested! I've got a study schedule implemented in my calendar to allow me to work a minimum of 40 hours per week and I'm following that as best I can with room to move blocks around if I need to. This is helping me keep motivated and not be hard on myself if I don't do what I had planned at the exact time as I'm able to shuffle things around. I've got the Toggl app on my phone and laptop so that I can track how well I'm keeping to this plan as well which I'm finding very helpful.
                </p>
              </div>
                  <p>
                    I'm pretty good at monitoring my stress levels and I'm not one to keep my mouth shut when I'm struggling - I love a good moan! The best way to deal with it, I find, is sharing it with another person. When you share your feelings you often find the people you think are coping well are just good at hiding it.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    I also feel its important to share your feelings with your peers as openly as possible as it allows others the space to do the same. 
                  </p>
                <h3>How and where you will seek help in a timely way?
                </h3>
                  <p>
                    Now that I've touched base with a number of the facilitators in Discord I feel like I can approach any of them easily enough as they are all very helpful and friendly.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    I also have my dad on stand by itching to help me with anything. He is a retired developer and is so excited that I'm getting stuck in! 
                  </p>
                <h3>
                  What do you expect from the Facilitation team?
                </h3>
                <p>
                  Just knowing that there are a team of experts on hand to answer the questions I can't find answers to in Google is very calming. So far if I've had a question it's been answered in a really timely manner so I'm assuming that's to be expected, and if so that's all I can ask for.
                </p>
                <h3>Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whānau commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.
                </h3>
                <p>I have a commitment to pick up my cousins from school a day a week during the last 2 weeks of foundations. I don't imagine this will be an issue as I'll be able to schedule my learning around it. But for bootcamp I'm a free agent.</p>
