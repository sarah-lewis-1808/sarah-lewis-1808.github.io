            <div>
              <h3>Describe a time when you were blocked on a problem...</h3>
              </div>
              <h4>What was the problem?</h4>
                <p> 
                  I'm learning that there is a stark difference between what I think is a problem and what is actually a problem. Often I find myself making problems where there aren't any and causing myself grief. I seem to find myself blocked daily when solving the exercises in this course and because I know that I tend to make problems where there aren't any I can spend too long trying to figure out what problem I have no doubt made up. I don't seem to be able to grasp what the questions are asking of me and I tend to over analyse the solutions. This week I was stuck for a good amount of time trying to make a thing do a thing in a way that wasn't asked because I was thinking ahead and putting myself in real world situations when the exercise was to just do-the-thing...

                  <h4>What problem-solving techniques did you use?</h4>
                  <p>
                  The majority of the time when I'm stuck with code I will rearrange all the wording and see if altering things slightly makes a difference. This is usually where I've gone wrong so I think maybe trying to be more aware of when I'm doing that for too long instead of moving on to a different approach might save me some time and energy.
                </p>
                  <h4>How did you feel throughout the process?</h4>
                  <p>
                  I absolutely love solving puzzles so I don't particularly dislike being stuck on something as having my brain stay busy is a relief from all the usual crap thats in there. 
                </p>
                  <h4>What did you learn?</h4>
                  <p>
                  From this experience I learned that I am stubborn - I need to accept that there is a time and a place to keep going on my own to try and fix something, and a fast paced course where there is definitely not unlimited time is not it!
              </p>
              <div class="blog-q"> <!--blog question 2-->
                <h3>Describe a time when you elegantly solved a problem</h3>
                <h4>What was the problem?</h4>
                <p>
                  There isn't really anything elegant about me, as my dear nan would tell me. I don't have the best memory recall either so trying to think of a time I did anything is hard...  
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  The only thing that is coming to mind is when I created a dynamic 'sales-team-proof' spreadsheet in my last job to help clients provide us with data in the right format to import to our app. It was pretty snazzy, although very niche. 
                </p>
                  <h4>What problem-solving techniques did you use?</h4>
                  <p>
                  I had help from two people in my team that were more proficient in Excel than me, and I used Google to find certain formulas.
                </p>
                  <h4>How did you feel throughout the process?</h4>
                  <p>
                  It was awesome working with my teammates on the same problem, as we all had a hard time with the process before we had the spreadsheet so when that worked we all felt pretty pleased. 
                </p>
                  <h4>What did you learn?</h4>
                  <p>
                  I learned that you can't possibly know everything, but attempting to learn something makes you more helpful and less of a burden to others. I also learned that there are some people that make money from purposely not knowing anything...

                <div class="blog-q"> <!--blog question 3-->
                <h3>Reflect on your confidence in using the following problem solving methods...</h3>
                <h4>Pseudocode</h4>
                <p>
                  Making diagrams and explaining each section line by line is how I roll. I need to understand what every line is doing before I can fully grasp the concept. I've been trying to include more comments in my attempts but theres a fine line between making comments to help you figure something out, and overwhelming your eyeballs with text. I haven't quite figured that line out yet.
              </p>
              <h4>Trying something</h4>
              <p>
                My default approach to life in general is to throw excrement and see what sticks. I didn't realise this was an actual method! Glad to hear it though. 
              </p>
              <h4>Rubber ducky method</h4>  
              <p>
                I'm pretty sure I talk to myself as I'm going so that kind of counts. I think my rubby ducky is a pen pal ducky though as I can't seem to get the words out to explain with my face. I find it much easier to type out my issue, as then I actually understand what I'm saying. The words tend to come out slower and more considered. 
              </p>
              <h4>Reading error messages</h4>
              <p>
                I kind of know what some of the things are saying, but when they are huge messages with loads of text and no red lines I get overwhelmed. In my last job we used Sentry, the error logging application which I was very scared of in the beginning. Then once someone explained to me that I only really needed to look at a couple of lines to have it help me I loved it. 
              </p>
              <h4>Console.logging</h4>
              <p>
                Console logging for me goes hand in hand with the trying something method. Every time I make a small change in the code I log it to the console to see what happened. I'm pretty confident that this works quite well in most cases, although not always. I can't always determine what the console is saying, but I'm sure it'll get better with more practice. 
              </p>
              <h4>Googling</h4>
              <p>
                I don't think I'd be alive without Google. When I lived in Indonesia google was my doctor. I'm pretty sure I broke my foot at one point, jumping into a pool whilst slightly intoxicated. Four years later I seem to be recovering well all thanks to Auntie Google, no thanks to my friend who suggested I get a massage to fix it...  
              </p>
              <p>
                I had no idea how many very specific questions were out there on forums for javascript, but I'm so grateful for them! I've managed to find the majority of the things I was looking for with minimal effort. 
              </p>
              <h4>Asking your peers for help</h4>
              <p>
                When I started my last job on day 1 of the first lockdown I quickly became acutely aware that if you want to make new friends in a high stress environment there is a quota of questions you can ask your peers per day. 
              </p>
              <p>
                I try to make sure I can gauge the situation before jumping head first in to annoying mode so I won't always go to my peers first especially if I know they are also struggling as I often find myself confusing people more when I try to help do something I'm not confident in already.
              </p>
              <h4>Asking coaches for help</h4>
              <p>
                I'm not as hesitant when it comes to coaches though as I know they will be able to point me in the right direction without a second thought. 
              </p>
              <h4>Improving your process with reflection</h4>
              <p>
                In my life long quest for efficiency I'm always reflecting on my thoughts, choices, decisions, attitudes, beliefs. I get great satisfaction from fine tuning life in general, and most people don't like it when I do it to them so I'll continue being my own best and worst critic!
