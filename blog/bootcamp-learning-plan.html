              <h3>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</h3>
              </div>
                <p> 
                  My long term goal is to spend the time I am working challenging my brain in a healthy productive way, and enjoy the stimulation that will bring. I don't want to spend the majority of my life in a job that is mind numbing and unexciting. I love puzzles and thinking, so I want to do more of that.
              </p>
              <p>I don't have a specific plan as such, but I do feel its important to work somewhere that aligns with my values, as this makes the job feel more fulfilling. 
              
              </p>
          </div> <!--blog question 1-->

            <div>
              <h3>What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?</h3>
            </div>
                <p> 
                  I think my biggest strength will be bringing my whole self every day. I don't have an off switch so I follow myself everywhere. 
              </p>
              <p>
                My limitations will be needing to understand everything before feeling like I've accomplished something. I think my need to dive into the detail and fully comprehend everything will slow me down and make me feel like I'm underachieving. I think I need to try to define a different way of knowing whether I've succeeded each day, rather than using my understanding of a particular topic as the benchmark of success.
              </p>

          <div class="blog-q"> <!--blog question 3-->
            <div>
              <h3>What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?</h3>
            </div>
                <p> 
                  I can get socially exhausted if I don't have enough time to rest and this may come across as me being grumpy, but its just that my whole self is always present and sometimes she doesn't have the energy to put the face on that matches the feelings. 
              </p>
          </div> <!--blog question 3-->
          <div class="blog-q"> <!--blog question 4-->
            <div>
              <h3>What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h3>
            </div>
                <p> 
                  I'm not great at verbal communication in general. I struggle to describe complicated systems and processes using only my words. I'd like to figure out how to do that better as it would help me in all aspects of my life. 
              </p>
          </div> <!--blog question 4-->
          <div class="blog-q"> <!--blog question 5-->
            <div>
              <h3>What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?</h3>
            </div>
                <p> 
                  I'm really looking forward to having a body in the room that I can approach with questions. I've found it hard to form some of my more complicated questions online so having a person I cant point things out to and grunt at will be really helpful... whilst I work on my verbal communication, obviously. 
              </p>
          </div> <!--blog question 5-->

              <h3>What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp</h3>
            </div>
                <p> 
                  She will be referring to herself in the third person as she has found that it helps her separate herself from the thoughts and feelings shes experiencing and allows her to personify herself as someone she is giving advise to... or has she spent too much time alone over the last 5 weeks...  
              </p>
              <p>
                I expect her to look after her wellbeing, eat healthily, and move her body even if it feels like a chore. I expect her to show up everyday refreshed and energised, ready to tackle new hard things. I expect her to look at challenges as fun puzzles, and not get frustrated if she has to have a lot of help to understand things. 
              </p>
