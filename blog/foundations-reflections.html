            <div>
              <h3>What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the core learning?</h3>
              </div>
                <p> 
                  I thought I was pretty self aware to begin with but as I have learned more about the ego and other core skills I've noticed that maybe my self awareness is quite retrospective and not as present as I would like it to be. 
              </p>
              <p>
                  I need people physically around me to keep me accountable, and not to stray too far from the tasks at hand. My ego seems to be more aware when people are present in the room so I have more of a focus on what I'm doing and how I'm behaving. I'm not sure whether this is a good thing or not... 
              </p>
              <p> 
                Seeing how a number of people have struggled through the core skills exercises, the core learning has made me realise how my 'soft skills' are almost more important than any other skills I may have, and that they are massively undervalued in the workplace. I've always known that they are undervalued in customer services roles, but I will do better to identify them in other people across the board and will make a point of appreciating them.

              <div class="blog-q">
                <div>
                <h3>What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?</h3>
                </div>
                  <p> 
                    Having values to guide your decision making allows you to feel fulfilled in what you do, and helps to create a sense of self belief and positive self attitude. If you can't back yourself others won't either. When learning new things its important to know why you are learning and if your values align with these reasons then you will find more motivation to keep going when it becomes challenging. 
                </p>
                <p>
                  Empathy will allow you to recognise other peoples feelings and make you a compassionate team member. This is important when collaborating on projects, and learning in groups as everyone will have valid thoughts and feelings that need to be taken into account. If only a few people are speaking their minds you aren't using your resources to their fullest extent and you may miss opportunities to make great decisions because some individuals were sidelined. 
                </p>
                <p>
                  Self awareness is essential for so many reasons. It is an integral part of knowing your limits, knowing your triggers, and is crucial for setting boundaries. If you are aware of yourself in any particular moment you can monitor how you behave towards others, which is important for working in teams. When taking on big projects its important to know your limits so you don't burn out. This is not only beneficial for you but makes you a better asset in the long run.

                <h3>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?
                </h3>
              </div>
              <p> 
                I've been most surprised by how much I've enjoyed it. It's not often anyone actually wants to ask vulnerability inducing questions. I've always felt that connecting with people on a deeper level and establishing meaningful relationships is reliant on vulnerability of some form, so having the opportunity to be so open and honest is a nice change.
              </p>
            </div> <!--blog question 3-->
            <div class="blog-q">
              <div>
              <h3>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?
              </h3>
            </div>
            <p> 
              I've found it particularly hard to not get sucked into the psychology of it all, and spend too much time looking into that aspect of it. I need to remember that I'm also here to learn to code, so I should stick to the time boxes! 
            </p>
          </div> <!--blog question 4-->
          <div class="blog-q">
            <div>
            <h3>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?
            </h3>
          </div>
          <p> 
            Having spent a lot of time with a lot of developers in the past I'm fully aware that there has historically been a gap on the emotional intelligence front. It's a shame that our society as a whole doesn't focus more on skills like these in general, as they are not only important for workplaces, but community as a whole. I hope that I can pass on some new found skills from these core modules to my community in some way. 
          </p>
        </div> <!--blog question 5-->
        <div class="blog-q">
          <div>
          <h3>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practice programming instead? Justify your answer.
          </h3>
        </div>
        <p> 
          Absolutely not. If I'd have had to focus only on coding I think I would have given up by now. Although I was familiar with them in some capacity already, having them at the front of my mind was so important whilst I was learning, especially being home alone. It can be very easy to forget to be kind to yourself and make time to look after yourself, so having it be part of the curriculum has really suited me.
