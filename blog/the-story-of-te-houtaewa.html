      <p>
      Te Houtaewa was the fastest runner of his day and played many pranks on his peoples enemies. One morning his mother wanted <span lang="mi">kumara</span> for the <span lang="mi">hangi</span> (earth oven) and asked <span lang="mi">Te Houtaewa</span> to go to the gardens at <span lang="mi">Te Kao</span>, a short distance away. He agreed to fetch the <span lang="mi">kumara</span> and told his mother to prepare the <span lang="mi">hangi</span>.
      </p>
      <p>
      Instead of going to the nearby gardens, <span lang="mi">Te Houtaewa</span> set off for <span lang="mi">Ahipara</span> as he wanted to annoy some <span lang="mi">Te Rarawa</span> people who lived there. Carrying two large baskets for the <span lang="mi">kumara</span>, he ran like the wind, completing the journey over the hard sands of <span lang="mi">Te Oneroa a Tohe</span> (Ninety Mile Beach) in the few hours it takes a good <span lang="mi">hangi</span> to heat up properly. On reaching <span lang="mi">Ahipara</span>, he went straight to the people's <span lang="mi">kumara pataka</span> (storehouse for the sweet potatoes) situated at the foot of the hill <span lang="mi">Whangatauatia</span>.
      </p>
      <p>
      While <span lang="mi">Te Houtaewa</span> was filling his baskets with <span lang="mi">kumara</span> he was spotted stealing the <span lang="mi">kai</span> (food). He was immediately recognised.
