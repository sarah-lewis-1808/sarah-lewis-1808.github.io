What is emotional intelligence? 
Emotional intelligence is having an awareness of feelings, emotions and behaviours of yourself and others around you. It is the ability to recognise, identify and analyse these unconscious feelings and emotions, allowing you to consciously adapt and channeling them into more productive behaviours and reactions. 

How is EQ different to IQ?
Intelligence allows you the ability to understand, solve and communicate complex logical concepts and ideas but ultimately is very self involved. Emotional intelligence allows the person to empathise with others and understand viewpoints other than their own. 

Why is EQ so important? 
You can be intelligent and understand something, but if that concept is unfamiliar to someone, or you are trying to communicate to someone very different from yourself you must first pull back a step and connect on a different level. 
Humans have evolved to be cooperative beings which has led to a lot of success for the species. This cooperation evolves changes with each growth and evolution of our society. In a more globalised world, where values, culture and differences are more pronounced than ever, and challenges for our species become more globalised we must continually strive to change the way we interact to ensure we remain a cooperative successful species. 
Emotional intelligence allows you to connect on a different level, work with and help others as well as yourself. When you can identify how and why someone is feeling a certain way and how you in turn are feeling and behaving as a response to that you are better able to manage your feelings and create a cooperative successful interaction with that person.
