              <h3>Neuroplasticity</h3>
              </div>
              <h4>What is neuroplasticity?</h4>
                <p> 
                  Neuroplasticity is the process of your brain rewiring itself after being presented with new experiences or stimuli. This is understood to be the process behind learning a new skill as a baby. When you start attempting something new your brain makes a new network of connections in order to do so. As a baby you are born with an innate ability to learn quickly and efficiently because this rewiring is at its most optimum between birth and 7 years old. It becomes less optimum after this age, but it doesn’t mean that it’s gone, it’s just more challenging to pick things up quickly. This is why adults find it so much harder to pick up new skills than children.
                </p>
                <h4>How does understanding the principles of neuroplasticity help when learning new skills?</h4>
                <p>
                  Studies have also shown that people who are aware of their brain's ability to adapt and rewire to new stimuli in this way tend to achieve better results in tasks than those that have a fixed mindset in relation to their innate ability. Those with a fixed mindset believe they are born with a certain unchanging ability and believe they will only be able to achieve up to a certain level of skill in something.
                </p>
                <h4>What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity?</h4>
                <p>
                  The phrase “practice makes permanent” is one I like, as this is referring to the ability being present, the neural connections in your brain being there, rather than the skill necessarily being honed. If you practice something everyday you will become better over time, but doing the activity once, even if it’s poorly, proves you have the ability to physically do it and you will get better at it with time. 
                </p>
                <p>
                  Several studies have found that participating in artistic based activities repetitively over a period of time can alter the participants neural network, eventually allowing such activities to become easier over time. 
                </p>
                <p>
                  Meditation has been shown to have an effect on the physical structure of the brain, showing that it is a tool that can be used to assist in the development of new networks. It was found to be particularly effective in brain regions associated with attention, anxiety, anger, depression and fear. 
                  </p>
                  <h4>Discuss how you might engage with the principles of neuroplasticity for your benefit.</h4>
                  <p>
                  As I’m working through this course I’m finding that my ability to meditate without my mind wandering is increasing with every attempt. I’ve also found that my ability to read code is getting better with increased exposure which is proving to me that my efforts are paying off.

              <h3>Growth Mindset</h3>
              </div>
              <h4>What is a growth mindset?</h4>
                <p>
                  A growth mindset is one in which a person understands the concept of neuroplasticity and how it assists in the development of a new skill. 
                </p>
                <p>
                  It’s very important when engaging in an activity that seems particularly challenging at first as this mindset helps the person push through bad days and know that just practicing something will yield long term results in ability. 
                </p>
                <h4>How will you integrate growth mindset into your learning journey?</h4>
                <p>
                  I’ve known about the growth mindset for a while but until now I’ve not fully attempted to embrace it before. Knowing that celebrating the small milestones is important has been something I’ve actively attempted to do. When I get stuck on something I try to make sure I reflect on that feeling once I’ve overcome that particular obstacle so I can be aware of what I’ve achieved. This not only helps me with my confidence but also allows me to be aware of each step in the learning. I’m finding it very important on this journey already and am already seeing the impacts of the little wins on the confidence I have in my ability to learn difficult things.
