        <p>Kia ora, I'm Sarah. I'm currently fortunate enough to be living with family in Waiake on the North Shore of Tāmaki Makaurau but I'm originally from Cymru Wales.</p>
        <p>I spent my 20s wandering around the world looking for the next new stimulating experience with no aim or desires, then fortunately landed in Aotearoa in 2018 and fell for all of it. Since being here I've thought about and experienced the importance of community and belonging and feeling connected to those around you. </p>

         <p>As someone who spent 33 years as an undiagnosed neuro-divergent I've often felt on the outside, so knowing that I'm not alone has been ground breaking. Now with the tools in place to help me succeed with my brain instead of against it, I'm finally able to challenge my potential. Dev Academy is the first step in proving my biases wrong and I'm hoping that I can gain skills to help contribute to my community in a meaningful way and assist others who may be feeling disconnected.

        <p>Bae Sain Ffraid - St Brides Bay in West Wales is really special to me, I spent a lot of summers there as a child in and on the water.</p>
